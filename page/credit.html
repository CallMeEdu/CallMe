            <p>
                Home mortgage is painful. Not only for borrowers, but also for lenders who work through the mounds of
                paperwork. As part of the process, the credit inquiry is one of the foundational pieces of the loan process. However, the
                current credit experience is being challenged by the disparated workflow, manual documentation process,
                and poor communication with borrowers. <br><br>

                With major banking clients such as JP Morgan Chase, TD Bank, HSBC, etc, Roostify is reinventing the home
                mortgage experience through a streamlined and automated digital mortgage platform.<br><br> Our goal is
                to ease lender stress by providing a more integrated, guided and collaborative credit experience, and
                ultimately, accelerate loan approval.

            <p>In the mortgage process, the credit check is initiated and completed by the lenders. As a result, we
                focused on leveraging the credit experience for lenders. However, smoothing out the borrower-facing
                steps can significantly accelerate the process and build the relationship between lenders and borrowers.

            <h2>Insights from the Loan Officers</h2>
        </div>
        <p>We interviewed 5 loan officers around their experience pulling credit. Our goals were to understand their
            current process and the challenges they face.</p>
        <h3>Reading of the credit report is frustrating</h3>
        <p>
            The current credit report for lenders is long-winded and frustrating,causing the loan officers to often miss
            the details they want to catch or misinterpret the information.

        </p>

        <h3>Follow ups surrounding a credit check is intense
        </h3>
        <p>

            Credit score is not the only deciding factor for loan approval. Ancillary follow-up actions and additional
            communication can be a burden to loan officers due to the manual processing.
        </p>
        <h3>Repeating keying data
        </h3>

        <p>
            The loan officers constantly switch between multiple systems to perform various tasks. Repeating keying data
            results in hard stops in their workflow.

            <p>Seeing a 720+ score is definitely the most exciting moment for lenders. However, most borrowers do not
                have, or are close to the satisfying score. Scrutinizing every single line of credit, requesting
                documents from borrowers, handing off data to the downstream can cause stress, anxiety and uncertainty
                in lendersâ€™ workflow.<br>Understanding the major pain for lenders, I proposed the following goals to
                guide the design:</p>

            </div>
            <p>Understanding what loan officers are dealing with is important to build the context. The existing credit
                reports (lender version) remain the PDF manner as years ago. The poorly structured content and a lack of
                visual focus bury the key information beneath.
                To validate our assumptions , we had a semi-structured interview with loan officers to understand what
                is important essentially for them to complete their work. </p>

                that are essential to loan officersâ€™ decision making. The tabs design was introduced to offer a full
                picture of the borrowerâ€™s credit history instantly, and to adapt to their reading habit: dig into the
                very bottom of the information when necessary. </p>

                Part of the project was also taking into consideration the multiple borrower requirement. When there are
                multiple borrowers in the application, the complexity also increases when loan officers have to navigate
                through different levels of information.

                reading is a pain, so I decided to hide the unecessary details and add more visual delightments. As we
                received more feedback, the problem shifted from how much information we should hide for a ease of

            </div>
            <p>One intersting finding we have discovered when solving this problem is: <br>
                If one of the borrowers showcases a really bad credit and is dragging down the overall credit score, the
                loan officers might remove the borrower from the application in order to improve the chance of loan
                approval. <br>
                This finding indicated the feature of borrower filter. The loan officers can toggle off one of the
                borrowers to view their invidual monthly debts and other credit information. As a result, the loan
                officers can run the scenario with one click so as to make better decisions for this loan.

            <p> Getting the credit report only opens the initial conversation with borrowers. there are lot of work that
                need to be done. Whenever there are things that need explanation, for example, why this borrower had
                this late payment last year. the loan officers will always request a letter of explanation. This is to
                help eliminate any potential problems or improve the credit before this application is sent to final
                underwriting.

                2. Lenders can prefill the letter on behalf of the borrower after they have a conversation about all the issues on the credit report. <br><br>
                3. Borrowers will only need to review and sign and letter.
