            A great residential community (e.g. condominium, college dormitory, etc.) provides a variety of amenities and a dedicated staff responsible for its maintenance . But there isnâ€™t always an easy way for community members to report problems to management so they can be resolved quickly. <br>Design a system for a community of your choice, so members can report issues and track their resolutions. Show your process and how you arrived at your solution. Please include a sequence of high-fidelity mocks from your design solution.

            Though the residents are the main users of my app, the staff' experience also matters because they are directly involved in the process. I talked to 4 tenants who have requested home maintenance before, and a property maintenance technicion with 5 years experience.

            I asked my interviewees to describe the process of requesting a maintenance service in details. They have requested a serive in both ways: through an online portal or contact management directly. Surprisingly, the online portal does not help improve the overall experience for the tenants. I visualized the experiences from both the tenants' and the technician's perspectives. I found out there were 3 main problems.

        <p-body>
           One big thing came out from the interview was: tenants cannot select the availabilities by themselves. There is a lot of turuaround time for them to schedule a maintenance. So, why can't we just provide the availabilities? This answer was too obvious to be true. The reason came out from my interview with the technician. <br>

           Surprisingly, users want to be at home when the technician comes.This indicates the problem of trust: users want to know when they came, what did they do and when they left. However, it is hard to collaborate on a time when they are both available.  <br>

           Tenants tend to request a service for some common issues they could have solved themselves.This not only costs the tenants' time, but also costs the technician's time for other urgent issues. Tenants lack the relevant knowledge even about some common issues. When they are unable to describe the problem clearly, the technician always have to come to check.   <br>

            My biggest learning from the interview was: Speeding up the service request is<thick> not solely a "maintenance"</thick> thing, it is a <thick>"team"</thick> thing. It's not between a tenant and a technician, it's among all the tenants, all the technicians.

            One challenge here was to help the tenants confirm the date faster. Previously they either do not know when the technician would come, or have to wait for the call from technician to confirm the date. We already know it is not as easy as providing them with a timetable because this will mess up technicians' work schedule, wich would in turn

            After considering the tradeoffs of these ideas, I was able to map out a new user flow to simplify and sreamlize the process. Some other needs, such as payment for unexpected cost, they happen less frequently. Thus I only focused on scheduling and tracking progress due to the time constraints.

            Without a face to face meeting, how can tenants describe the issue accurately? Based on the interview with the technician and several product analysis, I identified the following information as necessary to narrow down the problem. Since tenants always lack the knowledge to describe the issue, preset options are provided for users to select.

            However, selecting from 4 dropdown lists might be too tiring. The idea of "chatbot" came up in my mind. Can it help users skip the unnecessary input? However, when I think back to the real-life experience, the main reason that the problem is vague is because the tenants lack the professional knowledge to clarify the problem. If this causes any errors in the coversation, users will lose trust.

            Design a schedule experience for different use cases
        </h2>
        <p-body >
            When I was designing this part, I realized it has to scale at different use cases. We already know, it is not feasible to allow users book a time right away. Most users do not care when they will come, they just want to get confirmed without a long turnaround process.However, for users who lack the trust or think the issues are urgent, they hope to pick a specifc time.<br>
            I started from desiging a timetable to help users pick a specific time quickly.

     </div>  
      <p-body >
            I realized I have to balance between easy to select and flexible, not only flexible to the tenants, but also to the technician. I decided to go with the first because "tapping" is much easior on mobile, and this can avoid the situation when the tenant pick a small time slot. <br> 
            Based on my interviews, users don't usually have a time constraint about the time, so I put the "anytime" as default. A timetable will expand if users want to select a specific time.

       The most challenging yet interesting part of this problem is, I have to always remember I am not designing for one single user, but the whole community. Additionally, my design is only one part of a residential portal. How do the maintenance office organize and prioritize all the work orders? How do they coordinate with the tenants to improve work efficiency? How do the leasing office play a role in this process? These are all important aspects I need to take into consideration to make the whole system funtion well.

       In this process, I tried to brainstorm and explore new ideas as much as I could. Drawing and storytelling helped me a lot in visualizing the vague ideas in my mind and driving my decisions. I drew out a user story when I couldn't clarify the problem, I drew down all the design components to see how they can be layout on the page. This also helped me develop empathy becase I was able to put myself in the shoes of a user.
