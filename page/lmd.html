                To understand the value teachers see in documentation process and identify the current barriers, we

                time
                to documentation. However, they will only spend 0-15 minutes, which is the minimal time. We interviewed
                two
                teaching artists: Shannon Thompson and Jayla Patton and gathered their opinions on past, current and
                potential documentation practices. We also sent out the survey before conducting our on-site user study

                results
                since young children are not able to express their needs and feelings. Inspired by the Universal Methods
                of
                Design, we were prompted to use Cultural Probe as a way to gather childrens' hidden cognitive process.
                In
                the case of this cultural probe, students were asked to design museum of themselves. They were given an
                example of a floor plan of a museum and prompted to recall some of their own projects they could put on
                display. The resulting museum became a gateway into their motivation, interests, and organization of

                works.

                will
                the learners interact with capture + reflect interface? Can the projection nudge learners to document?
